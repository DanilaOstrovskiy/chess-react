## Chess Game App
This is a simple React-based chess game application. It allows you to play chess with two players and keeps track of lost figures for both white and black players.
In this learning project, I set out to work with the OOP approach.


## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

# Usage
When you open the application, it will start a new chess game.
The timer at the top of the screen shows the remaining time for the current player's turn.
Click on a chess piece to select it, and then click on a valid square to make a move.
The application will keep track of lost figures for both white and black players in the "Черные фигуры" (Black Figures) and "Белые фигуры" (White Figures) sections.
